Page 1. Instagram account hacked email changed reddit. Page 2.  › help › instagram. Have you received an email from Instagram letting you know that the email linked to your account has been changed, despite making no changes.

Account was hacked, email changed, then deleted. My instagram account was hacked, possibly because some dumb social website which had the same email/password was hacked a few days before. I changed all my passwords but forgot the instagram one. One morning, a friend told me my account was posting weird stuff. I couldn't log in to my account and. First, I'd like to thank this page for letting me voice my opinions and ask for advice. After sending multiple appeals, spamming multiple automated emails from facebook, contacted meta business facebook, and even wrote on twitter; I got a reply back 2 months later telling me that the pandemic made my case a non-critical issue and that they are focusing on more urgent cases. Instagram hacked, email and password changed, but I didn't receive a notification email to my original registration email! Password reset doesn't work, also when I enter my registration email it says "No users found".
