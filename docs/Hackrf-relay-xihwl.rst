 › JiaoXianjun › ADS-B-BTLE-air-relay-H. I had a look around and read a bit about PKE relay attacks, Once I saw the HackRF in the Lufsec post I made the connection and actually. Then uses a Raspberry Pi running RPiTX to generate a jamming signal, and the HackRF to capture and replay the car keyfob signal. Keyless Entry.
 
  · HackRF One is an SDR (Software Defined radio) working in transmission and reception in a wide frequency range. 1MHz to 6GHz. RTL-SDR is the cheapest and most well-known SDR working in reception only. Here we will discuss the connection of these 2 SDRs to an Orange Pi or a Raspberry PI and their operation with the GNU Radio software.  · Undoubtedly, one of the quickest ways to replay an RF signal when the signal center frequency is known is using the HackRF tool “hackrf_transfer“. By providing the required parameters, the HackRF can capture the desired transmission (while pressing the peripherals remote button), and then save the raw data to a file.  · 1. Share. Posted August Hi, I have 2 HackRF One modules, and I would like to use them to get access to the internet on my android phone, when I am in an area where there is no network coverage. The idea would be to connect my phone to the first one via usb, and to use the second one - a few hundred meters away - as a relay.
