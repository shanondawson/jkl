Hi, is there a list of compatible wifi and broadcom chipset that is compatible on hackintosh?

Massive Kudos to all who've worked on OC and modernizing the hackintosh process. Especially to those who wrote the docs. All you need to get running is right there. For those curious: Gigabyte Z Aorus Pro Wifi. i9 k. PowerColor RX XT. 32GB  DDR3. Broadcom WIFI/BT card. Surely there must be someone out there with the ability to make a kext to support Intel wireless cards on Hackintosh. I own a laptop with Intel wireless ac card and realized that it was not supported. So lets upvote this post folks and let the community see this post and maybe we'll get a kext for Intel wireless cards. 7 comments.
