 · For the average person unless you are just hell bent on having waze on the head unit then Ill be honest there really is not much reason to hack your head unit. As anything that can be done on the head unit with a hack can also be done on your phone anyway or with android auto or carplay.  · Posts. Discussion Starter · #1 · Jun 3, Hi all, yesterday I had issues with my Honda Hack (basic) Installed: Maps, Youtube, Waze, Sygic. Playstore, Google Play Account-thingy (dont remember the name) Than I updated each app thru Google Play. Dunno if that caused my following issue or not, but since than my system went slow as ****!  · I hear Waze works well with Honda Hack. But I can't use Waze since it relies on having a mobile data plan. I've had the Honda Hack on my wife's CR-V for about a week. Had been using use CoPilot app on my old iPhone 4s before Honda Hack and Sygic, since CoPilot has its maps offline on the phone, so no need for data plan for me.
